# HackingTools-for-Android
# Note : The app will show up as "AhMyth" for that is my compiler and I can't change this. Also, I have not used this program at all so just accept permissons and continue to use the app.
To download, click "view code" then click on "AriHacks" and click "view raw" and the app will start downloading. Then click on "AriHacks.apk" in your download folder and click install when the installation prompt comes up. And last, run the app and accept all permissons.
